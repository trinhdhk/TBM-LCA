## Background {-}
<!-- ::: -->

*Tuberculous meningitis* (TBM) is the one most mortal form of tuberculosis. Current expertise-based diagnosis comes with high uncertainty and performance of Ziehl-Neelsen smear (ZN Smear), mycobacterial culturing, and GeneXpert are suboptimal. We developed a diagnosis model that provides a statistically calibrated scoring system, on full and simplified scales, that estimates individual TBM risk, bacillary burden, and sensitivity and specificity of current confirmatory tests amongst adults with suspected brain infection.

## Methods {-}
<!-- ::: -->

We included 658 subjects from a prospective observational study conducted at Ho Chi Minh city Hospital of Tropical diseases from 2007 to 2021. We used a Bayesian latent class regression model with bacillary burden as random effects. Models were validated internally and a Shiny app was provided.

## Results {-}
<!-- ::: -->

All current confirmatory had over 99% specificity. The sensitivity of ZN Smear was 74% (57% - 88%), culturing was 40% (23% - 57%), and GeneXpert was 25% (11% - 47%). Stratified by HIV status, ZN Smear was 72% (55% - 87%) sensitive, culturing was 36% (18% - 54%) sensitive, and GeneXpert was 19% (04% - 43%) sensitive for HIV negative population. All test sensitivities were better in HIV group at 94% (85% - 99%), 86% (65% - 98%), and 92% (67% - 100%), respectively. All model showed good discrimination and calibration.

## Conclusion {-}
<!-- ::: -->

Our developed models could be objectively used as a decision assistant for clinicians to detect patients with high risk of TBM at different time points from early admission to later with test results.
