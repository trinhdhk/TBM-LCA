# Abstract {-}

## Background {-}

Diagnosis of Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is hampered by the lack of a gold standard. Current microbiological tests lack sensitivity and clinical diagnostic approaches are subjective. We built a diagnostic model that can be used before microbiological test results are known. 

## Methods {-}

We included 660 individuals aged $\geq 16$ years with suspected brain infection from a prospective observational study conducted in Vietnam. We fitted a logistic regression diagnostic model for TBM status, with unknown values estimated via a latent class model on three mycobacterial tests: Ziehl-Neelsen smear, Mycobacterial culture, and GeneXpert. We additionally re-evaluated mycobacterial test performance, mycobacillary burden for TBM patients, and the reduction in TBM risk after confirmatory tests were negative. We also fitted a simplified model excluding laboratory information and built a scoring system. All models were compared and validated internally.

## Results {-}

Patients with HIV, miliary TB, and long symptom duration were more likely to have TBM. Increased TBM likelihood was also associated with low CSF glucose, low paired blood glucose, high CSF protein, and high lactate. HIV and higher CSF protein were associated with higher mycobacillary burden. In the simplified model, HIV infection, long symptom duration, and clinical or radiological evidence of extra-neural TB were associated with TBM. At the cutpoints based on Youden's Index, the sensitivity of our full and simplified models are 86.0% and 83.0%; specificity are 88.0% and 72.0% respectively.

## Conclusion {-}

Our diagnostic model shows reliable performance and can be used as a decision assistant for clinicians to detect patients at high risk of TBM.
