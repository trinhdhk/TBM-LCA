### Background {-}

*Tuberculous meningitis* (TBM) is the one most mortal form of tuberculosis. Current expertise-based diagnosis comes with high uncertainty and performance of Ziehl-Neelsen smear (ZN Smear), cuturing, and GeneXpert are suboptimal. We developed a diagnosis model that provides a statistically calibrated scoring system, on full and simplified scales, estimations of individual TBM risk, bacillary burden, and sensitivity and specificity of current confirmatory tests amongst adults with suspected brain infection.

### Methods {-}

We included 658 subjects from a prospective observational study conducted at Ho Chi Minh city Hospital of Tropical diseases from 2007 to 2021. We used a Bayesian latent class regression model with local random effects. Models were validated internally and a Shiny app was provided.

### Results {-}

All current confirmatory had near perfect specificity. The sensitivity of ZN Smear was 71% (55%, 86%), culturing was 39% (23%, 55%), and GeneXpert was 23% (10%, 43%). Stratified by HIV status, ZN Smear was 69% (51%, 85%) sensitive, culturing was 35% (18%, 52%) sensitive, and GeneXpert was 18% (04%, 39%) sensitive for HIV negative population. All test sensitivities were better in HIV group at 93% (82%, 99%), 81% (58%, 96%), and 87% (56%, 100%), respectively. All model showed good discrimination and calibration. 

### Conclusion {-}

Our developed models could be objectively used as a decision assistants for clinicians to detect patients with high risk of TBM at different time points from early admission to later with test results.
