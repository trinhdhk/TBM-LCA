# Introduction

*Tuberculous meningitis (TBM)* is the most lethal form of tuberculosis. Diagnosing TBM is notoriously challenging, as no gold standard exists. Methods to dectect bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples include Ziehl-Neelsen staining (Smear) via direct visualisation, GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) that detect the existence of their DNA, and culturing in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). Their results can only be known after days or weeks. All lack sensitivity [@nhu2013; @chen2020] due to very low numbers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Additional clinical information, such as the duration of illness and the characteristics of the CSF, may assist in the diagnosis and there have been a number of diagnostic algorithms created that utilise this information [@thwaites2002; @moreira2008; @marais2010; @le2020]. However, many of these algorithms have not been validated thoroughly, especially for cases where all confirmatory tests returned negative and the true TBM status was unknown. Given TBM is almost always fatal if not treated, and any delayed treatment is strongly associated with death or severe neurological sequelae in survivors, physicians will usually opt to implicitly incorporate their experience to make the final decision. Under- and over-treatment are inevitable given the current inadequacy of diagnostic approaches. In 2010, a uniform case definition was developed as a standardised approach in clinical TBM research [@marais2010]. It was based on expert opinion, not by data analysis, and was never intended as a diagnostic tool and does not represent a gold standard. However, it illustrates the challenge presented by TBM. The case definition allocates cases to one of four diagnostic levels: *definite*, *probable*, *possible*,
and *not TBM. Definite* TBM includes those cases with microbiological or molecular confirmation of *M. tuberculosis* within the CSF. Typically, this represents around 30-40% of cases. The remaining cases are defined as *probable* or *possible,* encompassing an expert-generated scoring system where higher scores designate increased probability of a diagnosis of TBM. True TBM cases are likely represented by all *definite* cases, most *probable* cases, and some *possible* cases. Given TBM is almost always fatal if not treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, and delayed treatment is strongly associated with death or severe neurological sequelae in survivors, physicians will usually opt to implicitly incorporate their experience to make the final decision. Under- and over-treatment are inevitable. Â 

*Latent class analysis (LCA)* is a modelling technique that incorporates hidden traits and assigns a probability to have such traits based on observed variables. It has been used in social science, psychology, and recently adopted in several diagnostic studies, especially in Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) and TBM [@schumacher2016; @stout2018; @lahuerta-marin2018; @adams2019]. In our study, we used LCA to *(1)* re-evaluate the performance, namely sensitivities and specificities, of current TBM confirmatory methods - Smear, Xpert, and MGIT - against actual TBM status, taking into account the uncertainty in current diagnosis; *(2)* develop a calibrated scoring system that estimates the probability of TBM based on individual characteristics. Our secondary objectives were to build a simplified scoring system that only needs clinical and demographic information so that TBM risk can be easily calculated at admission; and to estimate a latent representation of individual mycobacterial burden in the cerebrospinal fluid.
