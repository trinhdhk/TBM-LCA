# Introduction

*Tuberculous meningitis (TBM)* is the most lethal form of tuberculosis. Diagnosing TBM is notoriously challenging, as no gold standard exists. A confimatory diagnosis of TBM requires identification of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); yet conventional tools - Ziehl-Neelsen smear (ZN-Smear) microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and culture in Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) lack sufficient sensitivity [@nhu2013; @chen2020].

As a results of the challenge of *Mtb* identification in paucibacillary CSF, a diagnosis of TBM is often guided by combining clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. due to very low numbers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Clinical data, such as the duration of illness and non-confirmatory CSF characteristics (e.g. white-cell count, glucose, etc.), may favour a diagnosis of TBM over others. A number of diagnostic algorithms have been created that utilise this information [@thwaites2002; @moreira2008; @marais2010; @le2020]. However, many of these have not been widely validated, especially for cases where the true diagnosis remained uncertain.

In 2010, a uniform case definition was developed as a standardised approach for clinical TBM research [@marais2010]. It was based on expert opinion, not by data analysis, and was never intended as a diagnostic tool. It hence does not represent a gold standard. However, the uniform case definition illustrates the challenge presented by TBM. It allocates cases to one of four diagnostic levels: *definite*, *probable*, *possible*,
and *not* TBM. *Definite* TBM includes those cases with microbiological or molecular confirmation of *M. tuberculosis* within the CSF.<!--Typically, this represents around 30-40% of cases.--> The remaining cases are defined as *probable* or *possible,* encompassing an expert-generated scoring system where higher scores designate an increased probability of a diagnosis of TBM. True TBM cases are likely represented by all *definite* cases, most *probable* cases, and some *possible* cases. Given TBM is almost always fatal if not treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, and delayed treatment is strongly associated with death or severe neurological sequelae in survivors, physicians will usually err on the side of giving treatment.

*Latent class analysis (LCA)* is a modelling technique commonly used in social science and psychology that infers the hidden traits and assigns probabilities to have such traits based on some observed characteristics. It has been recently adopted in several diagnostic studies, especially in Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) and TBM [@schumacher2016; @stout2018; @lahuerta-marin2018; @adams2019]. The rationale and formulation of LCA was discussed in the Clinical and Statistical supplementary documents. In our study, the hidden trait of interest is the unobserved TBM status, and the observed characteristics are three confirmatory tests (ZN-Smear, MGIT, and Xpert). This estimated TBM prevalence was used to *(1)* re-evaluate the performance, namely sensitivities and specificities, of the confirmatory tests and *(2)* develop a calibrated scoring system that estimates the risk of TBM from non-confirmatory clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. We additionally built a simplified scoring system requiring only clinical information and chest X-Ray which estimates TBM risk on hospital admission.<!--and estimated a standardised mycobacterial burden in the cerebrospinal fluid-->
