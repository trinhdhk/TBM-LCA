# Introduction

*Tuberculous meningitis (TBM)* is the most lethal form of tuberculosis. The diagnosis of TBM is notoriously challenging, with microbiological confirmation requiring identification of very low numbers of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Bacterial detection methods include Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and Mycobacterial culture, but all lack sensitivity[@nhu2013; @chen2020]. Additional clinical information, such as the duration of illness and the characteristics of the CSF, may assist in the diagnosis and there have been a number of diagnostic algorithms created that utilise this information [@thwaites2002; @moreira2008; @marais2010; @le2020]. However, many of these algorithms were not validated thoroughly, especially for cases where all confirmatory tests returned negative.

The major challenge in the development and assessment of any new TBM diagnostic approaches is the absence of a gold standard. A uniform case definition was developed 10 years ago as a standardised approach to reporting TBM research[@marais2010], but it was developed by expert opinion, rather than by data analysis, and was never intended as a diagnostic tool and does not represent a gold standard. However, it illustrates the challenge presented by TBM.

The case definition allocates cases to one of four diagnostic levels: *definite*, *probable*, *possible*,
and *not TBM. Definite* TBM includes those cases with microbiologic or molecular confirmation of *M. tuberculosis* within the CSF. Typically, this represents around 30-40% of cases. The remaining cases are defined as *probable* or *possible,* encompassing an expert-generated scoring system where higher scores designate increased probability of a diagnosis of TBM. True TBM cases are likely represented by all *definite* cases, most *probable* cases, and some *possible* cases. Given TBM is almost always fatal if not treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, and delayed treatment is strongly associated with death or severe neurological sequelae in survivors, physicians will usually opt to implicitly incorporate their experience to make the final decision. Under- and over-treatment are inevitable given the current inadequacy of diagnostic approaches. Â 

<!-- An alternative is to combine clinical and laboratory characteristics in a statistical model. In the absence of a gold standard, classical regression models do not suffice. *Latent Class Analysis (LCA)* is a technique which has been used for these settings. LCA is common in social science and psychology to detect different hidden traits[@Weller2020]. Recently, it has been adopted in several diagnostic studies, especially in Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) and TBM[@schumacher2016; @stout2018; @lahuerta-marin2018; @adams2019].

We implemented a LCA -->
In this analysis, we aimed to *(1)* re-evaluate the performance, namely sensitivities and specificities, of current TBM confirmatory methods - ZN Smear, Xpert, and mycobacterial culture - against actual TBM status, taking into account the imperfection in current diagnosis; *(2)* develop a calibrated scoring system that estimates the probability of TBM based on individual characteristics. Our secondary objectives were to build a simplified scoring system that only needs clinical and demographic information so that TBM risk can be calculated at admission; and to estimate a latent representation of individual mycobacterial burden in the cerebrospinal fluid.
