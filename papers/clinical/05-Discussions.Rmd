We used latent class analysis (LCA) to obtain a diagnostic model of tuberculous meningitis for patients with suspected brain infection. Upon validation, our model showed good calibration and discrimination. At the cut-point based on Youden's Index, the prevalence model surpassed the most sensitive confirmatory test Smear. Sensitivity of our simplified model using only clinical information was comparable to Smear in the general population. 

We also re-evaluated performance of the current confirmatory assays. Smear had highest sensitivity of `r sen('z_Smear', hiv=NULL)`, confirming prior studies [@nhu2013; @donovan2020]. Xpert performed poorly in HIV-uninfected individuals. All test performed much better in the HIV positive group, due to higher bacillary burden. With sensitivity and specificity both higher than 85%, either of the three tests can be used as a reliable standard for HIV infected individuals. In the general population, the estimated sensitivities were lower than in a recent study [@donovan2020]. However, since that study focused on TBM-suspected patients, HIV positive cases were more prevalent. Stratified by HIV status, values were more comparable.

Our analysis was not the first to use LCA to diagnose TBM. One study used data from the Vietnam National Lung Hospital, Hanoi [@le2020]. That study has a different target population, as it estimated TBM prevalence amongst individuals with TB of any type. They assumed all confirmatory test results to be independent which we could relax that assumption by including a model for mycobacterial burden. Different from earlier studies [@moreira2008; @le2020], we used non-confirmatory biomarkers as predictors<!-- why predictor heres-->, not as manifest variables. This allowed us to develop a calibrated scoring system for TBM based on disease related characteristics. Compared with the uniform case definition [@marais2010], we witnessed smaller weights on TB-suggested symptoms and cranial palsy, and a significant coefficient on HIV status. A novel quantification in our model is the latent mycobacterial burden. We found that higher lymphocyte count in CSF increases TBM risk but reduces the mycobacterial burden, which might lead to a less severe outcome [@Thao2018].

The calibration curves against three confirmatory tests showed some drop at the upper tails, particularly for MGIT culturing and Xpert, maybe due to the scarcity of patients with extreme probability of positive tests. <!--The preudo-calibration against the hospital diagnosis showed some level of overestimation around $x=0.7$. This suggests some misdiagnosis in practice, which motivates us to use the LCA, but might also due to some hidden factors we failed to capture. Further research is required.-->The pseudo-calibration against hospital diagnosis showed in overall good trend, suggesting a good correspondence between our model and clinical practice.

Our study has some limitations. One major challenge is the amount of missing data, especially in test results and HIV status. We had to make several assumptions, and despite the sensitivity analyses , this can bias the results. <!-- No interactions between covariates were considered due to limited sample size so potential association may have been missed.-->  Another disadvantage is the population from which our sample originated. Our study cohort was patients with suspected neurological infection, which involves physicians' judgment. Estimated TBM prevalence overestimated that in the general population. In most studies, they are the cohort of interest. However, when doing population surveillance, this must be taken into account. <!-- The third issue can come from our model design that is dependent on expertise and accidentally fusing some amount of noise could impact the overall estimates. -->
