We used a latent class approach to obtain a diagnostic model of TBM for patients with suspected brain infection. Upon validation, our model showed good calibration and discrimination. Using cutpoints based on Youden's Index, the full prevalence model surpassed the most sensitive confirmatory test ZN-Smear, while still managed with a good specificity. The sensitivity of our simplified prevalence model, using clinical and chest X-ray information, was comparable to ZN-Smear.

Contrary to the uniform case definition [@marais2010], both prevalence models consistently gives HIV infection a diagnostic significance. TB-suggestive symptoms, cranial nerve palsy, and miliary TB all have higher diagnostic weights when all CSF biomarkers are not included. The added variables in the simplified model all have significant values in TBM diagnosis. Other diagnostic features in general follow the prior belief, except for GCS where a higher consciousness level is associated with a higher risk of TBM, contrary to the case definition.

Our estimated TBM risk in general comparable with the hospital diagnosis made at discharge or death. This raises the confidence that both decisions are accurate. However, our model provides results far earlier.

A novel quantification in our model is the latent mycobacterial burden. We found that higher lymphocyte count in CSF is associated with increased likelihood of having TBM but with reduced mycobacillary burden. As lower mycobacillary burden is believed to reduce mortality, this is in line with a previous study, in which higher lymphocyte count has been linked to increased survival from TBM  [@thao2018] .

As a side-product, we also re-evaluated the performance of the current microbiological assays. In the overall sample, ZN-Smear had the highest sensitivity of `r sen('z_Smear', hiv=NULL, str = '{median} (95% CrI {ci})')`, confirming prior studies from our centre and reflecting the high level of technical expertise in conducting the test [@nhu2013; @donovan2020]. Xpert performed relatively poorly, especially for HIV-negative individuals. All tests performed much better for HIV-positive individuals, who had higher CSF bacillary burden. With sensitivity and specificity both higher than 85%, any of the three tests can be used as a reliable standard for HIV-positive individuals, although the performance of ZN-smear is likely to be impaired outside of expert laboratories. 

We are not the first to use LCA to help improve TBM diagnosis. A previous study from the Vietnam National Lung Hospital in Hanoi [@le2020] had a different target population and estimated TBM prevalence amongst individuals with TB of any type. They made the strong assumption that all confirmatory test results were independent. We could relax that assumption by including a model for mycobacterial burden. Unlike previous studies [@moreira2008; @stout2018; @le2020], we used non-confirmatory biomarkers as predictors, not as manifest variables. This implementation had two purposes. On the technical side, this lowers the risk of violating the aforementioned assumptions of independence between manifest variables. On the prediction side, this allowed us to develop a calibrated diagnostic model for TBM based on disease related characteristics. 

Our study has some limitations. There were missing data, especially in test results and HIV status. When imputing missing values we had to make several assumptions, that despite the validity checks of the imputation (Statistical supplementary document) could have biased the results. Another disadvantage is the population from which our sample originated. Our study cohort consisted of patients with suspected neurological infection, which involves physicians' judgement that might have been variably applied. In addition, the study was conducted in a specialist brain infections centre with high levels of clinical and laboratory expertise. The performance of CSF ZN-smear is higher than many other laboratories and therefore the results may not generalise to centres with less experience and expertise. Although there is less inter-laboratory variability in the performance of CSF Xpert and culture, this raises the need for an external validation.
