In conclusion, despite many past attempts to quantify microbiological test performance and develop diagnostic methods for TBM, this is amongst the first studies to utilise LCM and rigorously validate many assumptions made by the model. It was developed using a large cohort of adults with brain infection in Vietnam. Leveraging Bayesian inference, we extended the classical LCM and estimated individual mycobacillary burden. In a supplementary analysis, this burden showed good correspondence with a laboratory-based quantification (Clinical supplementary document). Our results therefore have a high relevance for clinical practice and research. Until a better gold standard is developed, can be used as reference for both the diagnosis of TBM and the estimation of severity - in both research and clinical settings.
