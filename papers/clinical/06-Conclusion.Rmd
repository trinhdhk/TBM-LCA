# Conclusion

Our LCA is the first to provide a thorough approach for TBM diagnosis, from admission, to days later with all confirmatory tests, with good discrimination and calibration values. Until a better gold standard being developed, our scoring system can be an objective diagnostic tool and baseline severity estimator in both clinical practice and research for TBM patients.
